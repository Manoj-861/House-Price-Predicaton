# House-Price-Predicaton
House Price Prediction uses Machine Learning to estimate house prices based on features like area, location, and number of rooms. The project includes data preprocessing, visualization, and model building using algorithms such as Linear Regression and Random Forest. It helps in making data-driven decisions for real estate pricing and marketanalysis
#  House Price Prediction  

The **House Price Prediction** project aims to predict housing prices using advanced **Machine Learning** algorithms. It analyzes various factors such as area, location, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and amenities to estimate property value accurately.  

This project includes **data preprocessing**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **feature engineering**, and **model building** using algorithms like **Linear Regression**, **Decision Tree**, and **Random Forest**. The goal is to create a predictive system that helps users make smart and data-driven real estate decisions.  

It provides detailed visualizations to understand how different features impact house prices and ensures reliable results through proper model evaluation metrics like RÂ² Score and RMSE.  

### Tools & Technologies  
- Python 
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

This project showcases the power of **data science in real-world business applications** and can be extended into a **web app** using Flask or Streamlit for live predictions.
